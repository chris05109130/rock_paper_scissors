Rock Paper Scissors Project

Description:
This project I decided to make the game that we all play called rock, paper, scisssors. All you do is click on one of the three images which is 
displayed on the webpage. The options being, rock, paper, scissors. Based on your selection, the computer will then generate there choice. So then 
it is now time to decide a winner. After each choice, you will see what your choice was, computer choice was followed by who won. Based on those results a point
will either go to you or the computer and there is a button to reset the game and play again 

This game was most needed for me to do because it shows that I know Javascript and being able to produce logic behind it such as being able to get your choice, and the 
computers choice and then being able to decide a winner
